# DataMining

## - Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Mining for COVID-19 pandemic using *Pyspark* 

## - Short Description & Introduction

The analysis was conducted for the purposes of the course in Data Mining during my postgraduate program in *Data Science & Machine Learning*. The dataset that we use for our analysis originates from the non-profit organization [*Our World in Data*](https://ourworldindata.org). The dataset was pulled from the following GitHub [link](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data). In this analysis we are mainly interested in extracting valuable information about the spreading and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic for the period 05/01/2021 - 30/06/2021. We describe and analyze how the pandemic affected and spread among different countries, continents and in the whole World in general.

- We produce visualizations to answer questions and enhance the findings of our analysis for the aforementioned period. For example, we would like to know *How the number of the new COVID cases evolved in Europe?*

Or *Which countries had had the most total Covid cases until the end of June 2021?*

## Coutries with highest total Covid cases until 30/06/2021</center>
